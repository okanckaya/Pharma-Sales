Since the main data set contains only three variables (period, province and quantitiy), it is obvious that new variables must be added to the data set in order to develop a suitable forecasting model. As stated in the Read.me file, when the variables that may affect the sales of a product group sold to male patients aged 60 and over are considered, the following variables come to mind:
 *Province and time based air temperature
Season
Whether the province is a big city or not
Region (Marmara, Black Sea etc.)
Stock market
Dolar exchange rate
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for year and month
Total male population in the province
Total male population in the rural areas
